# Homework 3: Plotly Charts

This repository contains the materials and resources needed to complete homework assignment focused on creating interactive visualizations using Plotly.

In this assignment, we'll be dealing with the population data of Bangkok, Thailand, focusing on each district within the city. Through the use of Plotly charts, we'll visualize various aspects of the population data, such as total population counts, population density, etc. Plotly's interactive features will allow us to explore the data dynamically, enabling us to identify trends, outliers, and patterns that may not be apparent from static representations.
